  summary: Reproducible Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
  description: |
    ReproBLAS aims at providing users with a set of (Parallel and
    Sequential) Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms that guarantee
    reproducibility regardless of the number of processors, of the
    data partitioning, of the way reductions are scheduled, and
    more generally of the order in which the sums are computed.
